    <h1>JSML - Javascript Markup Language</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Javascript has been a scripting language for so long, but now we are upgrading it.<br> We have added new functionalities and syntax to Javascript, And made JSML.<br> Here is an example of JSML code:

        <pre><code>
            <div JSML>
                p(Welcome to JSML!);
                <p>JSML also supports normal HTML inside!</p>
                p(JSML has a similiar syntax to JSX, and easily allows you to blue(color) text!);
            </div>
        </code></pre> The output would be:

        <pre>
            <code>
                <div JSML compiled>
                    <p>Welcome to JSML!</p>
                    <p>JSML also supports normal HTML inside!</p>
                    <p>JSML has a similiar syntax to JSX, and easily allows you to <span compiler style="color: blue;">color</span> text!</p>
                </div>
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
