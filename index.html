    <h1>JSML - Javascript Markup Language</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Javascript has been a scripting language for so long, but now we are upgrading it.<br> We have added new functionalities and syntax to Javascript, And made JSML.<br> Here is an example of JSML code:

        <pre><code>&lt;div JSML>
    p(Welcome to JSML!);
    &lt;p>JSML also supports normal HTML inside!&lt;/p>
    p(JSML has a similiar syntax to JSX, and easily allows you to paint(blue, color) text!);
&lt;/div></code></pre> The output would be:

        <pre>
<code>&lt;div JSML compiled>
    &lt;p>Welcome to JSML!&lt;/p>
    &lt;p>JSML also supports normal HTML inside!&lt;/p>
    &lt;p>JSML has a similiar syntax to JSX, and easily allows you to <span compiler style="color: blue;">color</span> text!&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></code>
        </pre> This is a live JSML example of the code shown above:

        <div JSML>
            p(Welcome to JSML!);
            <p>JSML also supports normal HTML inside!</p>
            p(JSML has a similiar syntax to JSX, and easily allows you to paint(blue, color) text!);
        </div>
    </p>

</body>
